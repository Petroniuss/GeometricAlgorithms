## Laboratories
1. Introduction to pyhton, jupyter, matplotlib - generating various sets of points and classifying them (whether to left or right with respect to some line)
2. Convex Hull - Implementation of Jarvis and Graham algorithm.
3. Detecting intersections between lines - Implementation of Bentley-Ottmann Algorithm.
4. Triangulation of polygons - Implementation of procedure triangulating y-monotone polygons.

### Notes
- Each script contains visualization for implemented algorithms
- Scripts could have used some polishing but there wasn't much time for that...
